# CPOO

This project was a group project for the course "Complement de CPOO" at Université Paris Cité.  
It was completed by me and Yassine Soueid.

## Aim of the Project
The aim of this project was to replicate the famous game *slither.io* in Java, applying the best coding practices learned during the semester.

## Implementation
The main part of this project was to build a TCP interface to make the game multiplayer over LAN. When running the game, it’s possible to host a self-hosted server, allowing other players on the same network to connect and play together. There is no limit on the lobby size.

## Future Plans
- [ ] Change the network protocol to UDP
- [ ] Implement a chat feature
- [ ] Improve network protocol performance for smoother gameplay
